## Outline

For our second GA project we were told to work in groups to create "Something awesome!"

Our ​*awesome*​ project is a dating app aimed at developers and people that love to code, we wanted to combine Tinder with Codewars.

A user can login using Facebook and is then shown other users pictures, if they like you they can then choose to 'heart' you by clicking the heart or swiping right. Otherwise by swiping left or selecting the cross they pass.

If another user also 'hearts' you, you are matched! Visit your matches page to chat.

But wait, how do we know you love code as much as we do. A user can set a test for potential matches to complete before the chat function is available. You can also test your compatibility on our love calculator.

If you both pass each others test, congratulations you can now use the chat function, or ignore each other like in real life.

Thanks to Joel, Wolf and Mike for all their help.




## COOL BEANS : 
- Facebook sign in and being able to grab user's facebook details to populate their profile upon sign in using Omniauth.
- A good database design can be simple, two well designed models being used in the right way
- Instant messaging chat
- Coding test implemented ( in the form of regex)
- Style and UI design thanks to pligins like superslide, jTinder, sweetalerts
- Love calculator using API

## CHALLENGES : 
- Understanding inverse_friendships and friendships and it's usage for the friendship model
- Working with js.erb files 
- Implementing the code test and figuring out the crud - ie what models we need and whether we even needed an extra one.

## TO FIX :
- Alternate login options, Github, Google+ 
- Chat bugs 
- UX Design
