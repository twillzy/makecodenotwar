status = initiated, acceptance, tests completed (chat ready)


STEPS

1. User 1 liked User 2's photo
	- new relationship created - user id, friend id, and status all assigned (status set to initiated)

	In params, you will have a user_id and a friend_id
		Are there any friendships with both of those IDs?
		If not, create a new friendship

	# relationship = Relationship.new user_id: 1, friend_id: 2, test_id: 3, status: "initiated"

2. User 2 likes User 1's photo
	- finds the relationship
	- status updated to ready (both have accepted) and test added

	In params, you will have both IDs
		There is going to be a friendship 
		This is where the match happens
		It's also where the test is assigned

	relationship = Relationship.find_by friend_id: @current_user.id, status: "initiated"
	relationship.update status: "ready"

3. Complete the tests
	- finds the relationship, sets the status to complete

	Find me the friendship where I am the user and someone else is the friend, get me that test
	We will both have to complete the test
	Once we have, we move on and we set the status to complete

4. Ready to chat

	relationship = Relationship.find_by friend_id: @current_user.id, status: "initiated"
	relationship.update status: "completed"

	It's complete, I am ready to chat
